Create a python virtual environment in Ubuntu
1.- python3-venv package that provides the venv module must be installed.

    sudo apt install python3-venv

2.-Within the desired directory run the following command to create your new virtual environment:

    python3 -m venv my-project-env

3.- To start using this virtual environment, you need to activate it by running the activate script:

    source my-project-env/bin/activate

    Once activated, the virtual environment’s bin directory will be added at the beginning of the $PATH variable
    Also your shell’s prompt will change and it will show the name of the virtual environment you’re currently using.
